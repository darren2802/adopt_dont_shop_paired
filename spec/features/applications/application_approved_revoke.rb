# As a visitor
# After an application has been approved for a pet
# When I visit that applications show page
# I no longer see a link to approve the application for that pet
# But I see a link to unapprove the application for that pet
# When I click on the link to unapprove the application
# I'm taken back to that applications show page
# And I can see the button to approve the application for that pet again
# When I go to that pets show page
# I can see that the pets adoption status is now back to adoptable
# And that pet is not on hold anymore
